<title>Gee - Open Access GTFS Editor - Help</title>
</head> 
<body>
<centre><h1> Gee Help </h1><centre>
<h2>What is Gee ?</h2>
Gee is a GTFS editor. It is an open access platform providing full GTFS editing capabilities. 
Users can create multiple GTFS instances, which they can share either globally (i.e make publicly readable or read & writeable), 
or colaborate across specific users.

<h2>Who is it for ?</h2>
Anyone 
<h2>How much does it cost ?</h2>
Nothing
<h2>Who do I complain to when it doesnt work ?</h2>
mc_lester@yahoo.co.uk
<h2>Are there any instructions?</h2>
A video and a proper looking doco page coming soon....<br>
For now, 
<ul>
<li> choose a database that you have access rights to. e,g. ""Bangladesh Railways" which is currently a publicly available sratchpad.
<li> click on a station not on the current trip (i.e. red or blue line shown and dark), you wil get green lines showing other trips that use this staion
<li> click on one of those green lines to make it the current trip to be edited. The stations will be now dark and a red ()or blue line if a shape is defuned for this trip) wil be shown
<li> note that the selection values on the route and trips selecftors on the left have changed to match your route.
<li> select the entity you wish to edit via the select lists on the left. click the create(blue), edit (green), or delete (red) buttons to do any of those actions 
<li> drag stations about the map to change their locations
<li> double click on the map away from a station or any blue or red lines and make anew station
<li> double click stations not on the current route to add the to the current route. you will have to come up with arrival and departure times that 
are in sequence with the other stops (else your route will dart off there first)
<li> double click on stations on the current route to edit. click the delete button on that dialog to remove a ststion from a trip
<li> double click on the red trip route line and it will generate a shape 
<li> drag the shape nodes about the map (shape nodes only contain location cords)
<li> double click anywhere on the blue shape line to add a new node
<li> double click on a shape node to delete it
<li> delete all the blue shape nodes and the red line will reappear
<li> you can also navigate the GTFS schema via the select listrs on the left. For each entity type (agency, route etc) there is a select list showing all the values that match any parent values 
that have been selected. e.g if we select a specific agency, only routes for that agency are shown, for any route select (initially the first in the list) only trips belonging to that route are shown, and the first one is selected. etc.
<li> next to each list there are blue green and red icons for create, edit and delete.  To create a new entity click the blue buttton, to edit the currently selected entity click green, anbd to delete this entity click red.
<hr>
<li> creating new databases is fraught with danger right now, but you could give it a go
<li> hit the blue (create) button on instance and give it a nice no spaces database name 
<li> you can then import a GTFS to it. Go get one from GTFS exchange or wherever and hit the upload button.
<li> hit the download button to make yourself a GTFS zip file
<li> in theory you can also import stops directly from OSM via Turbo though it needs testing and developing a little
<li> there is the underlying structure to have private collaborative groups,i.e you can give read, write or admin access to specific users. 
but there isnt any UI to that right now, but it wil appear when required.
<li> apart from debugging what we have already, the next phase is a publication manager to allow you to push you GTFS to an OTP 
beta instance, and subsequentlyy to a live Open Trip Planner web site.
