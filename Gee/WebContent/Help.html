<h2>What is Gee ?</h2>
Gee is a GTFS editor. It is an open access platform providing full GTFS editing capabilities. 
Users can create multiple GTFS instances, which they can share either globally (i.e make publicly readable or read & writeable), 
or colaborate across specific users.

<h2>Who is it for ?</h2>
Anyone 
<h2>How much does it cost ?</h2>
Nothing
<h2>Who do I complain to when it doesnt work ?</h2>
mc_lester@yahoo.co.uk
<h2>Are there any instructions?</h2>
A video and a proper looking doco page comming soon....<br>
For now, 
<ul>
<li> choose a database that you have access rights to. e,g. ""Bangladesh Railways" which is currently a publicly available sratchpad.
<li> select the entity you wish to edit via the select lists on the left. click the create(blue), edit (green), or delete (red) buttons to do any of those actions 
<li> drag stations about the map to change their locations
<li> double click on the map away from a station or any blue or red lines and make anew station
<li> double click stations not on the current route to add the to the current route. you will have to come up with arrival and departure times that 
are in sequence with the other stops (else your route will dart off there first)
<li> double click on stations on the current route to edit. click the delete button on that dialog to remove a ststion from a trip
<li> double click on the red trip route line and it will generate a shape 
<li> drag the shape nodes about the map (shape nodes only contain location cords)
<li> double click anywhere on the blue shape line to add a new node
<li> double click on a shape node to delete it
<li> delete all the blue shape nodes and the red line will reappear
<li> creating new databases is fraught with danger right now, but you could give it a go
<li> hit the blue (create) button on instance and give it a nice no spaces database name 
<li> you can then import a GTFS to it. Go get one from GTFS exchange or wherever and hit the upload button.
<li> hit the download button to make yourself a GTFS zip file
<li> in theory you can also import stops directly from OSM via Turbo though it needs testing and developing a little
<li> there is the underlying structure to have private collaborative groups,i.e you can give read, write or admin access to specific users. 
but there isnt any UI to that right now, but it wil appear when required.
<li> apart from debugging what we have already, the next phase is a publication manager to allow you to push you GTFS to an OTP 
beta instance, and subsequentlyy to a live Open Trip Planner web site.
 </ul>
